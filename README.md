# Fullstack Starter --- EXPERIMENTAL AND IN-PROGRESS

This should be eventually a fully written introduction to writing fullstack web apps simply in just JavaScript!

# How to set up your repo from scratch

First make sure you have installed Node. If you have not, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation specifics.

In your command line create a new directory and then open it:

```
mkdir my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
```

From here run the following command:

```
npm init
```

Follow the steps through. Don't worry, you can always update and change information later. What this does do, however, is create a file called package.json which is where all of our lovely instructions and information about our project goes! Find out more specifics on package.json files [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).

Your directory at the bare minimum should be laid out something like this:

```
Your Project Name Here
│   .gitignore
│   package.json
│   README.md
│
└───client
│   │   index.html
│   │   main.css OR index.css 
│   │   app.js OR index.js
│
└───server
│   │   server.js OR index.js
│   │   config.js
```

If you already know directory hierarchy you can ignore this next part! Otherwise stick around for a little bit with me.
